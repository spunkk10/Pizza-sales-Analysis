***Pizza Sales Analysis Project***

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to uncover meaningful insights that can help in making data-driven business decisions. The dataset was processed and analyzed using MS Excel for data cleaning, SQL for in-depth analysis, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. The objective was to identify sales trends, best and worst-performing pizza categories, customer preferences, and potential areas for business improvement.

**Tools Used**
MS Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing
SQL – Querying and analyzing sales data
Power BI – Creating interactive visualizations and dashboards

**Key Takeaways**

1) Underperformance of XXL Pizza:
          The XXL pizza size shows lower sales performance, suggesting a lack of demand or potential pricing issues.
   
2) Orders Trend:
         Orders peak on weekends, particularly Friday and Saturday during midday (11 A.M.–1 P.M.) and evening (6 P.M.).
         The highest number of orders occur in July and January, indicating seasonal demand fluctuations.

3) Best-Selling Pizzas:
         The Thai Chicken Pizza generates the most revenue.
         The Classic Deluxe Pizza leads in both total quantity sold and total orders placed.

4) Worst-Selling Pizzas:
        The Brie Carre Pizza has the lowest revenue, total quantity sold, and total orders.

5) Most Preferred Pizza Size
        The large-sized pizza is the most ordered, making it the preferred choice among customers.

6) Chicken Pizza Category Insights:
        The chicken pizza category has only six variants, leading to relatively lower sales.Expanding the category with more variety (similar to supreme, veggie, and classic categories) could boost sales.


**Conclusion**
     By leveraging SQL and Power BI, this analysis provided critical insights into pizza sales patterns. The findings can help optimize inventory, pricing, and promotional strategies to improve revenue and customer satisfaction. Future improvements can include expanding underperforming categories, optimizing peak-hour sales strategies, and adjusting pizza sizes based on customer demand.
