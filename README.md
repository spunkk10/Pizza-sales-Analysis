In this project, I used SQL queries, ranging from basic to advanced levels, to analyze pizza sales data and uncover valuable insights. Here are some key aspects I tackled:

Basic Queries:

Q1)Retrieve the total number of orders placed:
       This query helped us understand the volume of orders and the overall demand for pizzas.

Q2)Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales:
       By calculating the total revenue, we identified the financial performance and sales success.

Q3)Identify the highest-priced pizza:
      This query allowed us to recognize the premium products in our inventory.

Q4)Identify the most common pizza size ordered:
      Understanding the preferred pizza size helped in inventory and menu optimization.

Q5)List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities:
      We highlighted the most popular pizza choices among customers.

Intermediate Queries:

Q6)Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered:
      Merging data from different tables gave us a comprehensive view of pizza categories.

Q7)Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day:
      Analyzing order patterns by time helped in staffing and promotional strategies.

Q8)Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas:
      This provided insights into the popularity of different pizza categories.

Q9)Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day:
      Grouping and averaging orders by date helped us track daily performance and trends.

Q10)Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue:
     Identifying top earners highlighted the most profitable items.

Advanced Queries:

Q11)Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue:
      This analysis revealed the revenue impact of each pizza type.

Q12)Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time:
     Tracking cumulative revenue helped us understand growth patterns.

Q13)Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category:
     This detailed breakdown provided a deeper insight into category-specific performance.


Each of these queries contributed to a comprehensive analysis, providing valuable insights to drive strategic decisions.


** Key Insights:**

1)XXL pizzas underperformed with just 28 orders, suggesting discontinuation.
2)The "Classic" pizza category is the top choice among customers, showing strong preference.
3)Peak sales occur after 11 PM, while the 9â€“11 AM window shows minimal activity.
4)The Chicken pizza category has limited variety (6 types), creating untapped growth potential.
5)An average of 138 pizzas per order highlights the need for promotions to boost this figure.
